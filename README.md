## How to Play

### Objective

Collect all treasures on each level while avoiding traps and enemies. Each level increases in difficulty with more enemies and faster movement.

### Controls

- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow keys

### Game Elements

- **üí∞ Treasures**: Collect all to advance to next level
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Traps**: Damage player on contact, respawn after being triggered
- **üëπ Enemies**: Move toward player, damage player on contact
- **üß™ Potions**: Restore health when collected (rare spawns)

### Mechanics

- Player starts with 5 HP (maximum 10 HP)
- Taking damage from traps or enemies reduces HP by 1
- Game over when HP reaches 0
- Potions increase HP by 1 (only spawn every 3rd level)
- HP persists between levels (no more grinding early levels!)
- Enemy movement speed increases with each level
- More enemies and traps spawn as levels progress
- Responsive countdown dialogs before each level starts
